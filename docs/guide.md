### 1.  “2 d 6 + 3” — what the dice code means  
Dice notation is shorthand for *roll some dice, add (or subtract) a modifier*.

| Notation | English | Example outcome |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `2d6+3`  | Roll **2** six-sided dice (`d6`) and add **3** | (4 + 1) + 3 = 8 |
| `d20`    | Roll one 20-sided die | 17 |
| `3d4-1`  | Roll three four-sided dice and subtract 1 | (2 + 3 + 4) – 1 = 8 |

So our `Dice.roll("2d6+3")` helper  
1. parses the string,  
2. rolls random numbers,  
3. totals them with the modifier.

### 2.  A lightning-fast tour of D&D-style mechanics (as we’ll simplify them)

| Concept | Real D&D | Our slimmed-down version |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Character stats** | Six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, etc.), skills, feats | 3-4 core stats (e.g., STR, AGI, INT) stored in `Character` dataclass |
| **Hit Points (HP)** | When HP ≤ 0, you’re down | Same rule, tracked in the model |
| **Initiative** | Everyone rolls a d20; highest acts first | Use `Dice.roll("d20")` inside `Combat` |
| **Attack roll** | d20 + attack bonus vs. Armor Class | d20 ≥ enemy’s Defense → hit |
| **Damage roll** | Weapon-specific dice (e.g., 1d8) | Each `Item` carries a damage expression (`"1d8+2"`) |
| **Experience / Levels** | Complex leveling tables | We may skip levels at first or award simple +1s |

Gameplay loop:

```
Create character
↓
Campaign chooses next StoryBlock
↓
• If block is ENCOUNTER → run Combat
• Else (event/lore) → narrate effect
↓
Repeat until Resolution block reached
```

### 3.  How the code mirrors the rules

1. **`utils/dice.py`**  
   Central dice roller. Any game math—initiative, attacks, trap damage—routes through this.

2. **`models/`**  
   *   `Character` – player stats & methods like `attack(target)` (which call `Dice.roll`).  
   *   `Enemy`   – same interface, plus a bare-bones AI (`decide_action`).  
   *   `Item`    – optional gear with damage or stat bonuses.  
   *   `StoryBlock` – one chunk of narrative (has a `block_type` so Campaign knows what to do).

3. **`engine/campaign.py`**  
   Loads JSON arrays of blocks, applies your “random-but-ordered” rules, hands the next `StoryBlock` to the game loop.

4. **`engine/combat.py`**  
   * Order combatants by `Dice.roll("d20")`.  
   * Each turn: attacker rolls to hit (`d20 + STR`) vs. defender’s `defense`.  
   * If hit, roll weapon damage (e.g., `1d8+2`) and subtract from HP.  
   * End when one side drops to 0 HP.

5. **`engine/game.py`**  
   Controls the high-level flow:
   ```python
   while campaign.has_blocks():
       block = campaign.next_block()
       if block.is_encounter():
           Combat.run(player, Enemy.from_block(block))
       else:
           CLI.show(block.description)
   ```

6. **`cli/interface.py`**  
   Handles plain-text menus and user choices (attack / use item / flee).

Because *every* random element funnels through `Dice` and *every* game action lives in a model or engine module, you can tweak the rules in isolation—for example, switch to “best-of-two d20 rolls” luck mechanic—without touching the CLI.

### 4.  Putting it all together in your head

*Think of it like a board game engine and a narrator:*

1. **Campaign** shuffles story cards and says, “Next you meet goblins.”  
2. **Combat** rolls dice until the fight’s done.  
3. **Game** asks **CLI** to explain each step to the player and collect their choices.  
4. **Models** keep the numbers; **Utils** crunch the dice.

If you grasp just three verbs—*roll*, *compare*, *subtract*—you already know 90 % of the rules.

---

**Now you can read the skeleton code and see how each piece maps to these concepts.** When you’re ready to flesh out a module (say, critical hits or healing potions) just extend the relevant model or engine class and let the CLI describe the new behavior.
